## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness. It provides a calm, reassuring feel without being distracting. Choosing a blue that is not too dark also allows it to be versatile, which can contrast well with both light and dark backgrounds.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD) to provide a clean and professional backdrop that doesn't distract from the invoice content. This also provides enough contrast so elements on the UI stand out more for easier readability.
- Accent color: Darker shade of blue (#3949AB) for highlighting important elements such as buttons or calls to action, ensuring they stand out.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, known for its legibility and clean design, ensures readability across all screen sizes and devices.
